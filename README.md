MuMaMe - Mutation Mapping in Metagenomes

Mumame is a software tool that allows mapping of shotgun metagenomic reads to point mutations. It comes with a database builder that builds a special mutation database, which is then used by the main tool to map metagenomic reads using Usearch. It also comes with an R script to analyze the output data. For more information and installation instructions, see the manual or the published paper.
